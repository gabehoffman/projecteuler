# Gabe vs Project Euler

Project Euler Playground - from projecteuler.net
Solutions by Gabe Hoffman - gabehoffman@me.com

Project Euler is an online experiment in inductive learning. A series of challenging math problems designed to be solved on computers are laid out in a progressive order, with later problems building on the tools and ideas that you develop for earlier ones.
    
This playground is where I'll be putting my solutions and building my tools. My goal is to find concise solutions that make use of standard Swift best practices. I feel kinda bad about ignoring the wishes of the official Project Euler FAQ with regard to publishing solutions, but since so many people besides me have solutions up on github years, I don't think it's really an issue (and I need to GitHub to keep my solutions in sync at home and work). Also my focus is on Swift and not the answers.
    
SPOILER ALERT - If you keep reading, I'm assuming that you've already done them and want to compare notes (that's cool). Suggestions for improvement are welcome and encouraged. And if you think my code sucks? Awesome. Please tell me how I can improve. 

If you are just wanting to cheat...then feel free to ruin all the fun of these great challenges for yourself.
